# PyQt-age-calculator

This application is a application I developed whilst learning PyQt, it allows the user to enter their name and their date of birth. The application will then calculate their age by calcualting the number of years and days between the current date and time and their date of birth.

You can run this application by downloading the code and installing PyQt6 before running the code.
